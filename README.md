Â·I'm a boy.

Â·Since I contact programming, I've liked writing programmes so much that It takes me more than about 1 hour to write programmes every day.(It's a sentence which has many important grammars.)

Â·I'm good at English and geography.

Â·I'm not very well in Chinese and politics.

Â·I often get third in the exam.

Â·I'm a English class representative.

Â·@hacker-Fanjun is my e-friend.
